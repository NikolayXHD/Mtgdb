Pasting deck from Clipboard
Added `Paste` menu to window header and corresponding keyboard shortcuts
* `Ctrl`+`V` to create a new deck from Clipboard text
* `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`V` to add cards to an existing deck instead of creating new one

Drag-n-dropping deck text from websites and other applications. Works the same way as pasting.
* Normal `drag-n-drop` to create new deck from dragged text
* `Shift`+`drag-n-drop` to add cards from dragged text to an existing deck

I tested copy-pasting and drag-n-dropping in following websites:
* [http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/](sales.starcitygames.com)
* [https://www.mtggoldfish.com/](www.mtggoldfish.com)
* [https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/top-decks/what-we-learned-world-championship-2017-10-12](magic.wizards.com)
* [https://deckbox.org/decks/mtg](deckbox.org)

	I'm looking for something that searches for a deck based on the cards you have (or on a list you provide).
