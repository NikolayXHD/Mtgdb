Using Mtgdb.Gui to build deck for Sealed Deck match format in Forge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose you are playing Sealed Deck match in Forge. The first step is to build your deck from 90 
cards in Forge deck editor. Forge developers took care for all of us by supporting ``Ctrl`` + ``C``
to copy selected cards in List View mode from Deck editor. Now I took care too so you can ``paste``
selected cards as **Collection** in Mtgdb.Gui. The next step is to enable ``Filter by Collection`` 
and voila - you are working with the 90 cards from Sealed deck boosters to build your deck.

- In Forge select and copy (``Ctrl`` + ``C``) cards in List View mode.
- In Mtgdb.Gui 

  - in ``Paste menu`` pick ``Paste collection from Clipboard`` or press ``Alt`` + ``V``
  - filter by cards in collection

Now you can effectively build your deck from 90 cards available to you in Forge Deck editor.



Ufortunately there is a last-moment issue: my current version of Forge 1.6.4-r-1 fails to import
deck to Deck editor in Sealed Deck mode.

The bug was `reported <https://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=21186&p=220390#p220390>`_\ .
