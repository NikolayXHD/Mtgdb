issue description, importance statement
---------------------------------------

Example:

When I input my physical collection into the application I can't see both collection and the full 
catalog at the same time. So it is difficult to visually compare my progress with the physical 
piles of card in front of me. I have to constantly switch the filter by collection on and off. 
Also, the collection cards are not shown in any particular order which makes comparing with 
physical collection much harder.

suggested solution (not for bug reports)
----------------------------------------

Example:

I suggest showing the collection as one more tab in deck areas, in addition to Main Deck, Sideboard 
and Sample hand tabs. The order of cards in collection should be editable like it's in deck.

Steps to reproduce (for bug reports)
------------------------------------

Example:

1. Run the program
2. Wait until update window icon becomes enabled
3. Click it just after it became enabled

Result: the application crashes

Expected result: Upate window is shown
