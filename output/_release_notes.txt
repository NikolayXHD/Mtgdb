=== 2.0.7 ===

* Prices were updated not using Gatherer Extractor as it currently
fails to download prices.

* Update window shows progress bar when downloading images

* Fixed bug when loading 2 Forge decks consecutively.
When first deck has sideboard the second deck cards were all shown in
sideboard.

* Removed card property IsMagicDuels because Magic Duels game is changing
with time and the list of cards it supports needs to be maintained. I don't
do it so the list gets obsolete.

=== 2.0.6 ===

* Fine-tuned tokenization for search string index. +,-,/,½ are not
considered word separators anymore. As a result you can search +1/-1 in text
using a following query:
	text:\+1/\-1
It wouldn't work in previous versions as +1/-1 was indexed as
a sequence of two words "1" and "1" with +,-,/ characters omitted from
index.

* Fixed search result highlighting for Korean - it does use spaces to
separate words which I didn't know previously. An example query to see the
difference:
	text:*신*

* Fixed search text not working because of duplicate Id for cards Jaraku
the Interloper, Scarmaker in AllSets-x.json.

* Fixed startup delay between all sets loaded and images are selected.
The reason was redundantly expecting artwork images lookup to complete.

* Fixed stretching non-zoomed horizontal plane images
* Render icon for {CHAOS} symbol

=== 2.0.5 ===

* Added images for
	CMA - Commander anthology
	HOU - Hours of devastation
	E01 - Archenemy: Nicol Bolas

* Updated images for
	AKH - Amonkhet
	MPS_AKH - Amonkhet Invocations

Use Update window to download the most recent images

=== 2.0.4 ===

* Not rechecking all buttons in filter by Mana cost when unchecking last button.
* Fixed N/A filter button not working for cards with empty mana cost.
* 'Any deck' filter in open deck dialog.
* Tab header shows last saved or loaded deck file.
* Restoring search result scroll position after undo/redo or restart.
* Fixed creating redundant empty items in undo history when opening new tab.
* More comfortable snapping to top behaviour when dragging the window by its header.
* Reduced RAM memory consumption after loading is complete.
* Fixed hanging tooltip when the program window is suddenly overlapped by another.

=== 2.0.3 ===

* Documented possibility to reset filter buttons by middle-clicking them. Did
you know this? :) It was allways there, but forgotten to mention in help files or
tooltip.

* When Search string has focus but mouse is over search result or deck
PageDown / PageUp / Home / End keys affect both.

* Fixed a visual glitch on startup.

* Show total by cmc in deck Mana Curve report.

=== 2.0.2 ===

* Search result and deck react to PageDown / PageUp / Home / End keys without having
  to click them to pass input focus.

=== 2.0.1 ===

* Fixed weird behavior on maximizing window by Win+Up
* Made fields PowerNum, ToughnessNum nullable. This way empty values do not mix with 0
when sorting by these fields.

=== 2.0 ===

* CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) fixes
	1. Fixed not breaking lines in CJK text.
	2. Fixed Search String not accepting clipboard paste with CJK characters
	3. Fixed not highlighting CJK in search result. Example query: "リチ"~1
	4. Prevented underlining field value in Search string query as to keep CJK
	characters readable.

* Tooltip improvements
	1. Selectable text in search result tooltips - instead of messing with tiny
	   text fields.
	2. Highlighting search matches in tooltip.
	3. Better tooltip positioning.

* Deck statistics window changes
	1. The diagram has become more customizable.
	2. There is no more table above the diagram

* MS-Windows-version-independednt snapping. Even for Windows XP :)

	You can snap the window to the left or right side of the screen or one of 4 corners.
	To snap drag the window header to a screen side or corner. Alternatively use keyboard:
		for sides: Win+Left, Win+Right, Win+Num4, Win+Num6
		for corners: Win+Num1, Win+Num3, Win+Num9, Win+Num7
		to maximize: Win+Up, Win+Num8
		to minimize: Win+Down, Win+2
		to center: Win+5
		move to next screen: repeat any shortuct above

* 2D language menu rather than a linear list
* More precise tab header highlighting where tab trapezes intersect.
* Fixed 'jumping' in search result and deck when clicking partially visible card.
* Showing search string intellisense below the word you are typing.


* Got rid of all DevExpress UI (User Interface) controls. DevExpress is a paid .NET
Framework library providing extremly feature-rich controls to build UI. The consequences:

Loss of functionality

	1. Custom filter is no longer available. Use search string instead.
	2. No table above the diagram in deck statitics window.

Improved performance
	1. Search result filters, sorts and scrolls faster.
	2. Creating new tabs is faster.
	3. Resizing form is faster and with less visual glitches.

Reduced download size from 70 MB to 40 MB

Increased UI improvement potential:
	
	Many improvements in this release would't be possible if keeping DevExpress.

	~30% of code was about getting around DevExpress design flaws, bugs and gliches.
	It looks carefully designed and clean in demos and advertising pictures while on
	practice it doesn't do well some basic things.

	An example of that is search result highlighting - it is by design incapable to
	highlight more than 1 match per 1 field text (which is ridiculous!). That alone
	forced me to do all the text rendering myself. To the less degree same was true
	for scrolling, displaying partial cards, sorting, tabbed document interface...

=== 1.3.7.7 ===

* Possibility to create desktop shortcut from Update window
* When installing next version desktop shortcut is modified

=== 1.3.6.6 ===

* Fixed a problem of 'purely negative' clauses in Lucene query language syntax.
	
	A pure negative clause is one that only prohibits values. Example:
		NOT (Angel OR Demon)

	Lucene search engine does not evaluate this correctly. Shortly speaking 
	pure negative clause allways evaluates to FALSE. For more details see FAQ
	https://wiki.apache.org/solr/FAQ#Why_does_.27foo_AND_-baz.27_match_docs.2C_but_.27foo_AND_.28-bar.29.27_doesn.27t_.3F
	
	The fix was to add a 'Match any document' clause to any 'purely negative'
	clause turning a query like
		NOT (Angel OR Demon)
	to roughly
		* AND NOT (Angel OR Demon)

	Now the following query yields intuitively expected result:
		NOT(NOT (Angel OR Demon))
	returns any card that mentions either Angel or Demon in any field.

	Before that fix, the search result would be empty.

* Filtering by buttons is re-implemented using Lucene indexing mechanism. 
	
	Previously all the card texts were scanned to see if the card meets the conditions
	set by Filter buttons. The consequences are:

	1. Filtering by buttons may have become slighltly faster already.
	
	2. Filtering will not become slower as new sets are added.
	
	3. I could get rid of dirty hacky 'equip ' end 'enchant ' keyword definitions with
	trailing whitespace. A trailing whitespace was used to exclude words like 'equipped' or
	'enchanted'.
	
* Improved highlighting text matched by Buttons filter.

* Fixed search text syntax highlithing.
In a query ANDY first 3 chars were incorrectly highlighted as AND operator.

=== 1.3.6.5 ===

* New options in new configuration file 
	etc\Mtgdb.Gui.Display.xml

	* ShowTextualFields
	Set this option to "False" to display only card images in search result.
	With default value "True" textual card details are displayed in search result 
	alongside the card image.

	* ShowDeck
	Set this option to "False" to hide the deck area in the bottow of the window.

	* AllowPartialCards
	The purpose is to use window space effectively when the  window size is small.
	If you want to see only cards that completely fit whithin the window set the
	option value to "False".

	* CardSize
	Controls the size of card image shown in search result

	* ZoomedCardSize
	Controls the size of card image shown when you zoom a card

* Fixed zoomed image size being different depending on source file DPI.

=== 1.3.6.4 ===

* Help button replaced by help menu.

* Multi-field sort (For more details see help menu -> Help on Sort)
	* Shift+Click sort button to sort by a field while preserving existing sort by other fields.
	* Ctrl+Click sort button to stop sorting by a field.

NOTE: Sorting by multiple fields is actually available in previous versions.
But there are bugs I introduced by tweaking sort functionality not knowing
about availability of multi-field sorting.

* Added keyboard shortcuts
	Ctrl+T Open new tab
	Ctrl+Tab Move to next tab
	Ctrl+F4 close current tab
	Ctrl+O open deck
	Ctrl+S save deck
	Ctrl+P print deck

* Added a button to open configuration file to window header.

* Added some vertical space between filter by mana cost and other nearby filters
to guarantee showing tooltip on filter by mana cost

* Updated card prices

=== 1.3.6.3 ===
* Fixed crash on loading most recent cards data from mtgjson.com due to Loyalty 'X' instead of number
* Rebuilding full-text index after updating AllSets-x.json from Update window
* Showing progress when rebuilding full-text index

=== 1.3.6.2 ===
* Limiting Undo/redo history depth saved to file
	* The change only affects possibility of undo/redo after restarting. While using the program the undo/redo possibility is not limited in depth.
	* The amount of saved actions is limited by a setting <Undo MaxDepth="1000" /> in configuration file etc\Mtgdb.Gui.xml
	* After restarting you will not be able to do more than 1000 (or other number specified in config) undo or redo actions saved before you restarted the program
	* The formatting of history file is slightly changed to reduce it's size.

* Decreased delay of showing tooltip when hovering on text in search result.
* Not showing tooltip with all card information when hovering on card image.
* Added 'donate' button in form header.

=== 1.3.6.1 ===
Syntax highlighting in search text

=== 1.3.6.0 ===
Side deck supported, as promised :)

* Use main deck/sideboard tab headers to switch between deck areas
* Drag the card to a desired deck tab header to change deck area before dropping

=== 1.3.5.38 ===
* Dragging card to 'Add tab' button opens a new tab where you can drop dragged card

=== 1.3.5.37 ===
* Considered string Lucene query syntax escaping/unescaping when higlighting search result and selecting intellisense value

* Increased intellisense recall to make it more fuzzy like it was before using Lucene.
NOTE: As a consequence when first running this version full-text index is rebuilt (partially).

=== 1.3.5.36 ===
* Further improved wildcard term higlighting. 
query s??????????n results in whole 'Subterranean' highlighted with
'S' and 'n' emphasized so they can be visually distinguished from the rest of the word.

=== 1.3.5.35 ===
* Changed the way wildcard search results are highlighted
Now whe searching s??????????n the entire word 'Subterranean' will be higlighted.
Previously only starting 'S' and trailing 'n' were highlighted.

=== 1.3.5.34 ===
* Fine-tuning search string suggest behavior
* Fixed fulltext-index loading delay ~15sec on application startup when full-text index is already built

=== 1.3.5.33 ===
* Fixed highlighting word parts in search result that actually do not match search because of wildcards
* Fixed application startup crash in v1.35.5.32

=== 1.3.5.32 ===

* Fixed not searching by generated mana {E}
* Fixed not entering to edit mode when clicking by card's text

* Search text feature redisigned to support Lucene query syntax as specified at
https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html

It brings 2 major improvments
	
	* Showing value suggest after Ctrl+Space was really slow. Now it's fast.
	
	* The Lucene syntax itself is much more powerful than previously implemented.
		
		* Search by specific field:
			Name:Ooze 
		or by all fields:
			"Llanowar elves"
		quotes "" are used to search the entire phrase
		
		* You can construct arbitrarily nested boolean queries like
			Type:((angel OR demon) AND legendary)
		when no operators are specified, OR is applied
			Type:(Rogue Rat)
		matches either type
		
		* Using wildcard syntax you can control whether you search by word's prefix, suffix or you need exact word
			Subtype:(*ngel OR dem* OR human NOT rogue)
		Previously the text was allways searched at any position whithin the word like if you entered *ange*
		
		* Fuzzy search:
			nevniniral~
		will return Nevinyrral's Disk and other cards mentioning Nevinyrral in text.
		Previously fuzzy matching was only applied when suggesting values as you edited search text.
		You can refine your search by changing desired minimum similarity:
			nevniniral~0.2
		or
			nevniniral~0.9
		default similarity is 0.5, min is 0, max is 1
		
		* Proximity search
			"Mana color"~2 
		searches for text where words mana and color have 2 or less words between them.

		* You can correctly filter number fields like
			powerNum:[1 TO 4]
		The numbers are indexed as numbers, not as text so no power 11 cards will appear between 1 and 4.
			PricingMid:{100 TO *} will search cards with price strictly > than 100$
		you can also use range search with text fields:
			Name:[a TO ced]
		matches card with names containing any word which lies between 'a' and 'ced' in alphanumerical order
		
		* Term boosting is not supported because there is no sorting by relevance to search text.
			Angel^3 OR Demon
		such query is parsed and executed correctly but ^3 booster to Angel term is just ignored

=== 1.3.5.31 ===
* Drag-n-drop between tabs
While dragging the card you can switch to another tab an drop the card to the deck area.

=== 1.3.5.30 ===
* Cycling 3 states of sort buttons on fields None, Asecnding, Descending. Previously there was no way to clear sorting.


=== 1.3.5.22 - 1.3.5.29 ===
Migrating artwork metadata from file attributes to file name because NTFS extended file attributes reading is extremely slow.

=== 1.3.5.21 ===
* Added temporary images small and zoomed for AHK and MPS_AHK sets
* Supported flip cards from AHK set (like Heaven/Earth) naming to find matching images.

=== 1.3.5.20 ===
* Excluding [some metainfo] from cardname for image files with name like 'card name.[some metainfo].jpg'

=== 1.3.5.19 ===
* Detecting new version with same name. Useful if I forgort to increase version number

=== 1.3.5.18 ===
* Replaced token images for non-token cards when non-token image was available
* Fixed applying search text bug when more than one field was specified
* Fixed a bug causing application crash introduced in previous release

=== 1.3.5.17 ===
* Saving/loading deck fixes. In some cases cards from Forge or XMage were not matched because of diacritics in card name or similar problems.
* Image to card matching fixes. Added 309 card images. Now all cards have an image.

=== 1.3.5.16 ===
XMage deck format supported

=== 1.3.5.15 ===
Windows XP compatibility

=== 1.3.5.9 ===
Update from whithin the application. The update window can
* Download and install new version
* Download images of selected quality
* Download cards from mtgjson.com


=== 1.3.5.8 ===

Added filter by generated mana:

It filters card by color of generated mana and also by possibility to generate engergy.
It is more pricise and subtle than just looking at mana symbols in card's text. A simple
example: Paradise bird will be matched when you check {W}, while it's text doesn't mention
{W}. It tells "{T}: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool".

Minor changes:
* Search string intellisense bugfixes
* Increased size of artwork image in zoom

=== 1.3.5.7 ===

Search text:
* Added SetName, SetCode, ManaCost to fields looked up when field name not specified in search string
* Improved speed of applying search text without specifying a field.
* Improved painting highligted text to make higlighting of mana symbols clearly distinguishable
* Fixed not showing changed count after adding card to collection with Alt + right mouse click

Artwork images in zoom:
* When zooming a card with available artwork image, the artwork image will be shown first.

NOTE #1
If you'd like to help finding artworks you can upload images you've found to
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bya9eEE3vIkEc1d6SFVDQjBFdGM?usp=sharing
They will be arranged and available for downloading at
https://mega.nz/#F!D0oViaiI!o9yX1aVdyDnZ6mPIOHM1VA

aidscoi168 profile to ask questions:
http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=32434

NOTE #2
Mtgdb.Gui currently does not download artwork images itself. To get the images, download them from
https://mega.nz/#F!D0oViaiI!o9yX1aVdyDnZ6mPIOHM1VA
to \images\Artworks directory

NOTE #3
Artwork directory was added to config \etc\Mtgdb.Gui.xml
if you have your custom ..\etc\Mtgdb.Gui.xml with overriden directories, 
you will need to copy the new directory setting
<Directory Path="..\..\images\Artworks" Art="True" />

=== 1.3.5.6 ===
Search text:

Search text:
* Auto-applying search text after 1 second
* Non-applied search text is marked with light-blue background to make difference between applied and non-applied search text more explicit.
* Showing multi-line texts in search text suggest
* Highliting only relevant fields in search result - if the matching text is not in field where it was looked for it does'nt get's highlighted anymore.
* Highlight matched legality in ruling field
* Cltrl+Space on input starting with quote '"' shows value suggest instead of field suggest.
* No more implicitly applying AND to search text terms when no +/- before search value but different search fields are specified.

=== 1.3.5.3 ===
Legality:
* Manually added AER (Aether Revolt) legalities to custom legalities file, until mtgjson sets legalities for all AER cards.

Search string intellisense suggest:
* Suggest for search string without ':' suggests field names as before. To get non-fieldspecific values suggest use type ':', press Ctrl+Space
* Made suggest sorting a little faster

Filtering speed:
* Made filtering a little faster

=== 1.3.5.2 ===
Legality:
* Added separate group of filters by Legality
* Added fields LegalIn, RestrictedIn, BannedIn to search string
* Illegal, restricted or banned cards are marked visually in search result and deck

Search string fixes:
* Fixed exception when trying to get field list intellisence when value still empty.
For example typing 'leg:', move caret left, Ctrl+Space would lead to this exception.

Duplicates:
* When duplicates are hidden, showing the latest released one.

=== 1.3.5.1 ===
Search string fixes:
* Fixed searh not working without specifying field name.
* Fixed unnesessarily requiring quotes " even if search phrase or field name does not contain spaces.
* Fixed requiring field name with spaces like "Text En":"flying". Now you can use texten:flying without space and therefore without quotes.
* Fixed showing intellisense for other languages when field name is not specified (intellisense sorting became slower)
* Possibility to type part of field name like mana:u instead of manacost:u

=== 1.3.5 ===

* Editing collection cards that are available to you.
Use Alt + right click to add card to collection, Alt+middle click to remove.
Use Ctrl + Alt + right/middle click to add/remove 4 copies.

* Buttons to filter search result by 
** cards in collection
** cards in deck
