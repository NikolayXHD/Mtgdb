Help on search syntax

=== Introduction ===

	Searching is case-INsensitive

	IMPORTANT: Searh result includes only exact matches to the words in query unless wildcard symbols are used.
	a query 'angel OR demon' will not match words like 'angelic'.
	
	Wildcard symbols are: * - any characters or nothing, ? - any one character.
	To find all words like 'smash', 'smashed', 'smashing' use query 'smash*'

=== Search text syntax ===

	Search text uses Lucene query language as specified at
	https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html

	* Boolean operators and nesting
		((angel OR demon) AND legendary)

	* Search in a specific field
		Name:Ooze

	* Searh in any field
		disk

	* Quotes (")
	are used to search the entire phrase
		"Llanowar elves"
		
	When no operators are specified, OR is applied.
	The query below returns any card which types contain Rogue OR Rat
		Type:(Rogue Rat)

	* Wildcards
	Using * you can control whether you search by word's prefix, suffix or you need exact word
		Subtype:(*ngel OR dem* OR human NOT rogue)

	Using ? you can restrict word's fragments length.
	Use query below to search a word starting with su that has at least 6 characters
		su????*

	* Fuzzy search
	The query below will return Nevinyrral's Disk and other cards mentioning Nevinyrral in text
		nevniniral~ 

	You can refine your search by changing desired minimum similarity.
	Default similarity is 0.5, min is 0, max is 1.
		nevniniral~0.2
		nevniniral~0.9

	* Proximity search
	The query below searches for text where words mana and color have 2 or less words between them.
		"Mana color"~2 

	* Range search
	You can correctly filter number fields like this:
		powerNum:[1 TO 4]

	The numbers are indexed as numbers, not as text so no power 11 cards will appear between 1 and 4.

		PricingMid:{100 TO *} 
	will search cards with price strictly > than 100$

	You can also use range search with text fields. Query below matches card with names containing any word which lies between 'a' and 'ced' in alphanumerical order
		Name:[a TO ced] 

	* Term boosting
	Term boosting is NOT supported because Mtgdb.Gui does not currently sort by relevance to search query.
	The query below is parsed and executed correctly but ^3 booster to Angel term is just ignored
		Angel^3 OR Demon
