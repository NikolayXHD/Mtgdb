		* AllowPartialCards
		The purpose is to use window space effectively when the  window size is small.
		If you want to see only cards that completely fit within the window set the
		option value to "False".
		
		* ShowTextualFields
		Set this option to "False" to display only card images in search result.
		With default value "True" textual card details are displayed in search result 
		alongside the card image.
		
		* Show deck
		Set this option to "False" to hide the deck area in the bottow of the window.
