	<!-- === Directories with card images. Path can either be relative to application directory or absolute.
		When you edit this, set the Path in a way that it's first subdirectory begins with set code.
		The program will use it to correctly assign a picture to a card when there are matching images in different sets.
		Example:

				D:\Distrib\XLHQ Mega\BFZ - Battle for Zendikar
