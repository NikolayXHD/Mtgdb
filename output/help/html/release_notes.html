			<h2 id="section">2.2.5</h2>
<p>Replaced plain-text help with locally stored help website which you can explore in your
web-browser. Help website is generated from <code>.txt</code> files using Markdown syntax.</p>
<p>In case you need them you can find <code>.txt</code> help files in <code>\help</code> directory.</p>
<h2 id="section-1">2.2.4</h2>
<p>Changed transparency key on zoomed image to a color that has no matching pixel in any current
zoomed image. Previous value was matching some pixels in Hours of Devastation set, leading to
pixel-size defects in zoom.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">2.2.3</h2>
<p>Added online wiki reference to help menu</p>
<h2 id="section-3">2.2.2</h2>
<p>Fixed Basic Lands image mapping for sets</p>
<ul>
<li>Amonkhet, all basic lands;</li>
<li>Duel Decks Divine vs Demonic, two swamps.
XLHQ image numbers fore these sets do not match mtgjson.com numbers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-4">2.2.1</h2>
<p>Fixed bug in Update window preventing downloading Artworks</p>
<h2 id="section-5">2.2.0</h2>
<p>Minor changes in picture rendering.</p>
<p>Revised mapping XLHQ directories to Mtgjson.com set codes. Sets MMA, RQS, ITP, NMS, CST, CON, MD1
have different codes in XLHQ Mega arhive. Mtgdb.Gui images were updated correspondingly. You can
download updated small and zoom images from Update window.</p>
<h2 id="section-6">2.1.9</h2>
<p>Supported dropping multiple (up to 10) deck files. Second and subsequent decks are opened in new
tabs.</p>
<h2 id="section-7">2.1.5 - 2.1.8</h2>
<p>Dropping deck file from explorer opens a deck. You can drop to deck area or search result. Only
1-file drop is accepted.</p>
<p>Fixed some Forge picture replacement algorithm flaws</p>
<p>Update notifications</p>
<p>Fixed non-transparent zoomed image corners with some new images</p>
<h2 id="section-8">2.1.4</h2>
<p>Updated data</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Commander 2017, Ixalan sets</li>
<li>Updated translations to non-english languages</li>
</ul>
<p>Updated images</p>
<ul>
<li>Added images for Commander 2017, Ixalan sets</li>
<li>Improved relevance for many old promo-sets images by manually mapping directories from XLHQ
Promos Torrent and XLHQ Mega directory promo sets</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: If you use XLHQ images (instead of images downloaded from Update window) you should update
etc\Mtgdb.Gui.xml to enjoy more relevant mapping images to cards from promo-sets. Use
etc\Mtgdb.Gui.xml from Mtgdb.Gui.2.1.4.zip as a reference. You can find .zip in update\ directory
or download from <a href="https://goo.gl/LuC6ce">https://goo.gl/LuC6ce</a></p>
<p>Increased image size</p>
<p>Slightly increased image size in search result and deck to avoid quality loss on resizing
original wizards.gatherer.com images for new sets.</p>
<p>NOTE: if you have changed image size in etc\Mtgdb.Gui.Display.xml you will have to do this again.
Use etc\Mtgdb.Gui.Display.xml from Mtgdb.Gui.2.1.4.zip as a reference. You can find .zip in
update\ directory or download from <a href="https://goo.gl/LuC6ce">https://goo.gl/LuC6ce</a></p>
<p>Search text</p>
<ul>
<li>Ctrl+F to focus Search input</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect Ctrl+X behavior</li>
<li>underscore _ is considered normal word character</li>
</ul>
<p>Issue with replacing Forge images</p>
<p>Old sets in Forge have codes different from regular codes from Mtgjson.com. Now when replacing
images these custom set codes are taken into account.</p>
<h2 id="section-9">2.1.3</h2>
<p>Fixed the bug in hiding card duplicates algorithm</p>
<p>Previously the card was considered duplicate when there were more recently released namesake.
This worked ok except when you search by set. In this case many cards from the set are not shown
at all because there is a more recent version in another set. The fix is to check existence of a
more recent version only among other cards that comply to the search criterion.</p>
<h2 id="section-10">2.1.2</h2>
<p>In search string curly braces {,} are considered normal word characters</p>
<p W B>As a result a query ManaCost: {W} yields only the cards with ManaCost exactly equal to 
instead of cards like {3},  and etc.</p>
<p W>To control the precision of the query use * or ?. The query ManaCost: <em>{W}</em> will return all
cards that contain  in their mana cost.</p>
<p B R>Consider a query ManaCost: {B}??? It returns cards with mana cost beginning with  and
containing 1 more mana symbol after: , , and etc.</p>
<p>Side note: as since 2.1.1 the indexes are packaged with the program no index rebuilding will be
required.</p>
<h2 id="section-11">2.1.1</h2>
<p>Tooltips on Sort and Search buttons</p>
<p>Eliminated the need to rebuild search indexes after</p>
<ul>
<li>installing the program first time</li>
<li>installing new version with changed data like
<ul>
<li>cards from mtgjson.com</li>
<li>prices</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall download size increased from ~40MB to ~70MB. I find it a reasonable cost to cutting
~6 minutes of waiting for the program to become fully functional.</p>
<p>The indexes will still be rebuilt when you download new data yourself using update window.</p>
<h2 id="section-12">2.1.0</h2>
<p>Search icon over card text</p>
<p>When you hover a mouse over card text you can see a Search icon. It is in most cases followed by
Sort icon.</p>
<p W>By clicking Search icon you modify the search text. For example, if you click Search icon over
card's mana cost you will see something like ManaCost: {3}{W}{W} added to your search
string As a result the search result will only show cards that contain in mana cost {3}</p>
<p>When you add more than one search terms you are ADDING more cards to search result. This is
because when no logical operator such as AND, OR is used it is interpreted as OR in Lucene query
language used in Search text.</p>
<p>By Shift+Clicking Search button you can instead NARROW DOWN search result. It is achieved by
adding terms with '+' operator which is almost equivalent to AND</p>
<h2 id="section-13">2.0.9</h2>
<p>Fixed collection report unreadility when it cannot be well fit into one screen.</p>
<h2 id="section-14">2.0.8</h2>
<p>Statistics window</p>
<ul>
<li>Added 'collection price' report</li>
<li>Added 'filter by search result' checkbox. Use it to see the price of only the part of your deck
or collection that match search criteria from the search result window.</li>
</ul>
<p>Search text input</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fixed flickering in search input when text was ~100 characters or longer. It was usually
happening when pasting big chunks of text into search input.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Escaping special symbols when pasting into search input. 2004-11-20 converts to 2004-11-20
Without escaping 2004-11-20 gets interpreted as 2004 AND NOT 11 AND NOT 20</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy-pasting within search input does not involve escaping to avoid double-escaping</li>
<li>When pasting a text into search input it gets separated by whitespaces from the rest of
query to avoid field value to merge with field name of pasted text and vice-versa.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>When pasting text from tooltip to search text it is converted to a valid field-value query like
ReleaseDate: 2004-11-20</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowed using $ in filter for number fields. Previously that would be considered syntax error.
That makes pasting a price from a tooltip to produce valid query PricingMid: $1.50</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tooltips</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased tooltip font</li>
<li>Added 'selectability' icon on selectable tootlips</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-15">2.0.7</h2>
<p>Update window</p>
<ul>
<li>Added button to update prices.</li>
<li>Update window shows progress bar when downloading images</li>
<li>Prices were updated not using Gatherer Extractor as it currently fails to download prices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed bug when loading 2 Forge decks consecutively
When first deck has sideboard the second deck cards were all shown in sideboard.</p>
<p>Removed card property IsMagicDuels</p>
<p>because Magic Duels game is changing with time and the list of cards it supports needs to be
maintained. I don't do it so the list gets obsolete.</p>
<h2 id="section-16">2.0.6</h2>
<p>Fine-tuned tokenization for search string index. +,-,/,½ are not considered word separators
anymore. As a result you can search +1/-1 in text using a following query: text:+1/-1 It
wouldn't work in previous versions as +1/-1 was indexed as a sequence of two words &quot;1&quot; and &quot;1&quot;
with +,-,/ characters omitted from index.</p>
<p>Fixed search result highlighting for Korean. It does use spaces to separate words which I didn't
know previously. An example query to see the
difference: text:<em>신</em></p>
<p>Fixed search text not working because of duplicate Id for cards Jaraku the Interloper, Scarmaker
in AllSets-x.json.</p>
<p>Fixed startup delay between all sets loaded and images are selected. The reason was redundantly
expecting artwork images lookup to complete.</p>
<p>Fixed stretching non-zoomed horizontal plane images</p>
<p CHAOS>Render icon for  symbol</p>
<h2 id="section-17">2.0.5</h2>
<p>Added images for</p>
<ul>
<li>CMA - Commander anthology</li>
<li>HOU - Hours of devastation</li>
<li>E01 - Archenemy: Nicol Bolas</li>
</ul>
<p>Updated images for</p>
<ul>
<li>AKH - Amonkhet</li>
<li>MPS_AKH - Amonkhet Invocations</li>
</ul>
<p>Use Update window to download the most recent images</p>
<h2 id="section-18">2.0.4</h2>
<p>Not rechecking all buttons in filter by Mana cost when unchecking last button.</p>
<p>Fixed N/A filter button not working for cards with empty mana cost.</p>
<p>'Any deck' filter in open deck dialog.</p>
<p>Tab header shows last saved or loaded deck file.</p>
<p>Restoring search result scroll position after undo/redo or restart.</p>
<p>Fixed creating redundant empty items in undo history when opening new tab.</p>
<p>More comfortable snapping to top behaviour when dragging the window by its header.</p>
<p>Reduced RAM memory consumption after loading is complete.</p>
<p>Fixed hanging tooltip when the program window is suddenly overlapped by another.</p>
<h2 id="section-19">2.0.3</h2>
<p>Documented possibility to reset filter buttons by middle-clicking them. Did you know this? :) It
was allways there, but forgotten to mention in help files or tooltip.</p>
<p>When Search string has focus but mouse is over search result or deck PageDown / PageUp / Home /
End keys affect both.</p>
<p>Fixed a visual glitch on startup.</p>
<p>Show total by cmc in deck Mana Curve report.</p>
<h2 id="section-20">2.0.2</h2>
<p>Search result and deck react to PageDown / PageUp / Home / End keys without having to click them
to pass input focus.</p>
<h2 id="section-21">2.0.1</h2>
<p>Fixed weird behavior on maximizing window by Win+Up</p>
<p>Made fields PowerNum, ToughnessNum nullable. This way empty values do not mix with 0 when sorting
by these fields.</p>
<h2 id="section-22">2.0</h2>
<p>CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) fixes</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed not breaking lines in CJK text.</li>
<li>Fixed Search String not accepting clipboard paste with CJK characters</li>
<li>Fixed not highlighting CJK in search result. Example query: &quot;リチ&quot;~1</li>
<li>Prevented underlining field value in Search string query as to keep CJK characters readable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tooltip improvements</p>
<ul>
<li>Selectable text in search result tooltips - instead of messing with tiny text fields.</li>
<li>Highlighting search matches in tooltip.</li>
<li>Better tooltip positioning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deck statistics window changes</p>
<ul>
<li>The diagram has become more customizable.</li>
<li>There is no more table above the diagram</li>
</ul>
<p>MS-Windows-version-independednt snapping. Even for Windows XP :)</p>
<p>You can snap the window to the left or right side of the screen or one of 4 corners.
To snap drag the window header to a screen side or corner. Alternatively use keyboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>for sides: Win+Left, Win+Right, Win+Num4, Win+Num6</li>
<li>for corners: Win+Num1, Win+Num3, Win+Num9, Win+Num7</li>
<li>to maximize: Win+Up, Win+Num8</li>
<li>to minimize: Win+Down, Win+2</li>
<li>to center: Win+5</li>
<li>move to next screen: repeat any shortuct above</li>
</ul>
<p>2D language menu rather than a linear list</p>
<p>More precise tab header highlighting where tab trapezes intersect.</p>
<p>Fixed 'jumping' in search result and deck when clicking partially visible card.</p>
<p>Showing search string intellisense below the word you are typing.</p>
<p>Got rid of all DevExpress UI (User Interface) controls. DevExpress is a paid .NET
Framework library providing extremly feature-rich controls to build UI. The consequences:</p>
<p>Loss of functionality</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom filter is no longer available. Use search string instead.</li>
<li>No table above the diagram in deck statitics window.</li>
</ul>
<p>Improved performance</p>
<ul>
<li>Search result filters, sorts and scrolls faster.</li>
<li>Creating new tabs is faster.</li>
<li>Resizing form is faster and with less visual glitches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reduced download size from 70 MB to 40 MB</p>
<p>Increased UI improvement potential:</p>
<p>Many improvements in this release would't be possible if keeping DevExpress.</p>
<p>~30% of code was about getting around DevExpress design flaws, bugs and gliches. It looks
carefully designed and clean in demos and advertising pictures while on practice it doesn't do
well some basic things.</p>
<p>An example of that is search result highlighting - it is by design incapable to highlight more
than 1 match per 1 field text (which is ridiculous!). That alone forced me to do all the text
rendering myself. To the less degree same was true for scrolling, displaying partial cards,
sorting, tabbed document interface...</p>
<h2 id="section-23">1.3.7.7</h2>
<p>Possibility to create desktop shortcut from Update window.</p>
<p>When installing next version desktop shortcut is modified.</p>
<h2 id="section-24">1.3.6.6</h2>
<p>Fixed a problem of 'purely negative' clauses in Lucene query language syntax.</p>
<p>A pure negative clause is one that only prohibits values. Example: NOT (Angel OR Demon). Lucene
search engine does not evaluate this correctly. Shortly speaking pure negative clause allways
evaluates to FALSE. For more details see FAQ
<a href="https://wiki.apache.org/solr/FAQ#Why_does_.27foo_AND_-baz.27_match_docs.2C_but_.27foo_AND_.28-bar.29.27_doesn.27t_.3F">https://wiki.apache.org/solr/FAQ#Why_does_.27foo_AND_-baz.27_match_docs.2C_but_.27foo_AND_.28-bar.29.27_doesn.27t_.3F</a>
The fix was to add a 'Match any document' clause to any 'purely negative' clause turning a query
like NOT (Angel OR Demon) to roughly AND NOT (Angel OR Demon) Now the following query yields
intuitively expected result: NOT(NOT (Angel OR Demon)) returns any card that mentions either
Angel or Demon in any field. Before that fix, the search result would be empty.</p>
<p>Filtering by buttons is re-implemented using Lucene indexing mechanism.</p>
<p>Previously all the card texts were scanned to see if the card meets the conditions set by Filter
buttons. The consequences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filtering by buttons may have become slighltly faster already.</li>
<li>Filtering will not become slower as new sets are added.</li>
<li>I could get rid of dirty hacky 'equip ' end 'enchant ' keyword definitions with trailing
whitespace. A trailing whitespace was used to exclude words like 'equipped' or 'enchanted'.</li>
</ul>
<p>Improved highlighting text matched by Buttons filter.</p>
<p>Fixed search text syntax highlithing. In a query ANDY first 3 chars were incorrectly highlighted
as AND operator.</p>
<h2 id="section-25">1.3.6.5</h2>
<p>New options in new configuration file etc\Mtgdb.Gui.Display.xml</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ShowTextualFields
Set this option to &quot;False&quot; to display only card images in search result. With default value
&quot;True&quot; textual card details are displayed in search result alongside the card image.</p>
</li>
<li><p>ShowDeck
Set this option to &quot;False&quot; to hide the deck area in the bottow of the window.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-AllowPartialCards
The purpose is to use window space effectively when the window size is small. If you want to see
only cards that completely fit within the window set the option value to &quot;False&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CardSize
Controls the size of card image shown in search result</p>
</li>
<li><p>ZoomedCardSize
Controls the size of card image shown when you zoom a card</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed zoomed image size being different depending on source file DPI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-26">1.3.6.4</h2>
<p>Help button replaced by help menu.</p>
<p>Multi-field sort (For more details see help menu -&gt; Help on Sort)</p>
<ul>
<li>Shift+Click sort button to sort by a field while preserving existing sort by other fields.</li>
<li>Ctrl+Click sort button to stop sorting by a field.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Sorting by multiple fields is actually available in previous versions. But there are bugs I
introduced by tweaking sort functionality not knowing about availability of multi-field sorting.</p>
<p>Added keyboard shortcuts</p>
<ul>
<li>Ctrl+T Open new tab</li>
<li>Ctrl+Tab Move to next tab</li>
<li>Ctrl+F4 close current tab</li>
<li>Ctrl+O open deck</li>
<li>Ctrl+S save deck</li>
<li>Ctrl+P print deck</li>
</ul>
<p>Added a button to open configuration file to window header.</p>
<p>Added some vertical space between filter by mana cost and other nearby filters to guarantee
showing tooltip on filter by mana cost</p>
<p>Updated card prices</p>
<h2 id="section-27">1.3.6.3</h2>
<p>Fixed crash on loading most recent cards data from mtgjson.com due to Loyalty 'X' instead of number</p>
<p>Rebuilding full-text index after updating AllSets-x.json from Update window</p>
<p>Showing progress when rebuilding full-text index</p>
<h2 id="section-28">1.3.6.2</h2>
<p>Limiting Undo/redo history depth saved to file</p>
<ul>
<li>The change only affects possibility of undo/redo after restarting. While using the program the
undo/redo possibility is not limited in depth.</li>
<li>The amount of saved actions is limited by a setting <Undo MaxDepth="1000" /> in configuration
file etc\Mtgdb.Gui.xml</li>
<li>After restarting you will not be able to do more than 1000 (or other number specified in
config) undo or redo actions saved before you restarted the program</li>
<li>The formatting of history file is slightly changed to reduce it's size.</li>
</ul>
<p>Decreased delay of showing tooltip when hovering on text in search result.</p>
<p>Not showing tooltip with all card information when hovering on card image.</p>
<p>Added 'donate' button in form header.</p>
<h2 id="section-29">1.3.6.1</h2>
<p>Syntax highlighting in search text</p>
<h2 id="section-30">1.3.6.0</h2>
<p>Side deck supported, as promised :) Use main deck/sideboard tab headers to switch between deck
areas. Drag the card to a desired deck tab header to change deck area before dropping</p>
<h2 id="section-31">1.3.5.38</h2>
<p>Dragging card to 'Add tab' button opens a new tab where you can drop dragged card</p>
<h2 id="section-32">1.3.5.37</h2>
<p>Considered string Lucene query syntax escaping/unescaping when higlighting search result and
selecting intellisense value</p>
<p>Increased intellisense recall to make it more fuzzy like it was before using Lucene.
NOTE: As a consequence when first running this version full-text index is rebuilt (partially).</p>
<h2 id="section-33">1.3.5.36</h2>
<p>Further improved wildcard term higlighting. query s??????????n results in whole 'Subterranean'
highlighted with 'S' and 'n' emphasized so they can be visually distinguished from the rest of
the word.</p>
<h2 id="section-34">1.3.5.35</h2>
<p>Changed the way wildcard search results are highlighted. Now whe searching s??????????n the
entire word 'Subterranean' will be higlighted. Previously only starting 'S' and trailing 'n' were
highlighted.</p>
<h2 id="section-35">1.3.5.34</h2>
<p>Fine-tuning search string suggest behavior</p>
<p>Fixed fulltext-index loading delay ~15sec on application startup when full-text index is already
built</p>
<h2 id="section-36">1.3.5.33</h2>
<p>Fixed highlighting word parts in search result that actually do not match search because of
wildcards</p>
<p>Fixed application startup crash in v1.35.5.32</p>
<h2 id="section-37">1.3.5.32</h2>
<p E>Fixed not searching by generated mana </p>
<p>Fixed not entering to edit mode when clicking by card's text</p>
<p>Search text feature redisigned to support Lucene query syntax as specified at
<a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html">https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html</a></p>
<p>It brings 2 major improvments</p>
<ul>
<li>Showing value suggest after Ctrl+Space was really slow. Now it's fast.</li>
<li>The Lucene syntax itself is much more powerful than previously implemented.</li>
</ul>
<p>Search by specific field:
Name:Ooze</p>
<p>or by all fields:
&quot;Llanowar elves&quot;
Quotes &quot;&quot; are used to search the entire phrase</p>
<p>You can construct arbitrarily nested boolean queries like
Type:((angel OR demon) AND legendary)
when no operators are specified, OR is applied</p>
<p>Type:(Rogue Rat)
matches either type</p>
<p>Using wildcard syntax you can control whether you search by word's prefix, suffix or you need
exact word
Subtype:(<em>ngel OR dem</em> OR human NOT rogue)</p>
<p>Previously the text was allways searched at any position within the word like if you entered <em>ange</em></p>
<p>Fuzzy search:
nevniniral~
will return Nevinyrral's Disk and other cards mentioning Nevinyrral in text.
Previously fuzzy matching was only applied when suggesting values as you edited search text.</p>
<p>You can refine your search by changing desired minimum similarity:
nevniniral<sub>0.2
or
nevniniral</sub>0.9</p>
<p>Default similarity is 0.5, min is 0, max is 1.</p>
<p>Proximity search
&quot;Mana color&quot;~2
searches for text where words mana and color have 2 or less words between them.</p>
<p>You can correctly filter number fields like
powerNum:[1 TO 4]
The numbers are indexed as numbers, not as text so no power 11 cards will appear between 1 and 4.
PricingMid:{100 TO *} will search cards with price strictly &gt; than 100$</p>
<p>you can also use range search with text fields:
Name:[a TO ced]
matches card with names containing any word which lies between 'a' and 'ced' in alphanumerical order</p>
<p>Term boosting is not supported because there is no sorting by relevance to search text.
Angel^3 OR Demon
such query is parsed and executed correctly but ^3 booster to Angel term is just ignored</p>
<h2 id="section-38">1.3.5.31</h2>
<p>Drag-n-drop between tabs. While dragging the card you can switch to another tab an drop the card
to the deck area.</p>
<h2 id="section-39">1.3.5.30</h2>
<p>Cycling 3 states of sort buttons on fields None, Asecnding, Descending. Previously there was no
way to clear sorting.</p>
<h2 id="section-40">1.3.5.22 - 1.3.5.29</h2>
<p>Migrating artwork metadata from file attributes to file name because NTFS extended file
attributes reading is extremely slow.</p>
<h2 id="section-41">1.3.5.21</h2>
<p>Added temporary images small and zoomed for AHK and MPS_AHK sets</p>
<p>Supported flip cards from AHK set (like Heaven/Earth) naming to find matching images.</p>
<h2 id="section-42">1.3.5.20</h2>
<p>Excluding [some metainfo] from cardname for image files with name like
card name.[some metainfo].jpg</p>
<h2 id="section-43">1.3.5.19</h2>
<p>Detecting new version with same name. Useful if I forgort to increase version number</p>
<h2 id="section-44">1.3.5.18</h2>
<p>Replaced token images for non-token cards when non-token image was available</p>
<p>Fixed applying search text bug when more than one field was specified</p>
<p>Fixed a bug causing application crash introduced in previous release</p>
<h2 id="section-45">1.3.5.17</h2>
<p>Saving/loading deck fixes. In some cases cards from Forge or XMage were not matched because of
diacritics in card name or similar problems.</p>
<p>Image to card matching fixes. Added 309 card images. Now all cards have an image.</p>

<p>NOTE #2
Mtgdb.Gui currently does not download artwork images itself. To get the images, download them from

<p>NOTE #3
Artwork directory was added to config \etc\Mtgdb.Gui.xml if you have your custom
..\etc\Mtgdb.Gui.xml with overriden directories, you will need to copy the new directory setting
<Directory Path="..\..\images\Artworks" Art="True" /></p>
