Sorting search result
---------------------

https://github.com/NikolayXHD/Mtgdb/blob/master/output/help/img/sort.jpg?raw=true

By default the cards are sorted in the same order they appear in data\AllSets-x.json file. You 
can sort by most fields you see in search result. To make `sort` button visible move the mouse 
over a field you want to sort.

Sort by multiple fields
-----------------------

To sort by more than one field use Shift+click on sort button on second and subsequent fields.

Three-state cycle: Descending-Ascending-None
--------------------------------------------

Clicking sort button cycles between 3 states:
- first click makes sort direction Ascending
- second click changes direction to Descending
- third click stops sorting the field

Stop sorting one field
----------------------

There are two ways to exclude a field from sorting.

- Shift+click sort button until it becomes not sorted.
By using Shift you preserve any existing sorting by other fields.

- Ctrl+click sort button.
The clicked field stops being sorted. Any other sorted fields remain sorted.

Cancel sorting on all fields
----------------------------

Click sort button (without holding Shift) on any field until it becomes not sorted.
Because Shift key is not down while clicking, other fields are excluded from sorting too.
