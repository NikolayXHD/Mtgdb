Some MTG webistes let you download the deck in `*.txt` format. Then you can open it as MTGO *.txt 
deck. However the website `download deck` button is not always easy to find, and sometimes there 
is none. Also it's not that fast to locate the downloaded file in `Load deck` dialog.

I implemented Copy-paste & Drag-n-drop deck text features to cut-down and unify the hassle as 
much as I can.

Pasting deck from Clipboard
---------------------------

You can find `Paste` menu before save / load buttons in window header.

- `Ctrl`+`V` to create a new deck from Clipboard text
- `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`V` to add cards to an existing deck instead of creating new one

Drag-n-dropping deck text from websites and other applications
--------------------------------------------------------------
Works the same way as pasting.
- Normal `drag-n-drop` to create a new deck from dragged text
- `Shift`+`drag-n-drop` to add cards from dragged text to an existing deck

Copy-pasting and drag-n-dropping were tested in following websites
