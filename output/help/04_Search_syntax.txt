Introduction
------------

Searching is case-INsensitive

IMPORTANT: Searh result includes only exact matches to the words in query unless wildcard symbols 
are used. A query `angel OR demon` *will not* match words like `angelic`.

Wildcard symbols are: `*` - any characters or nothing, `?` - any one character. To find all words 
like `smash`, `smashed`, `smashing` use query `smash*`

Search text syntax
------------------

Search text uses [Lucene query language](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html)

Boolean operators and nesting

    ((angel OR demon) AND legendary)

Search in a specific field `Name:Ooze`

Searh in any field 

    disk

Quotes " are used to search the entire phrase

    "Llanowar elves"

When no operators are specified, OR is applied. The query below returns any card which types 
contain Rogue OR Rat 

    Type:(Rogue Rat)

Wildcards

Using * you can control whether you search by word's prefix, suffix or you need exact word 
    
    Subtype:(*ngel OR dem* OR human NOT rogue)

Using ? you can restrict word's fragments length. Use query below to search a word starting with 
su that has at least 6 characters 

    su????*

Fuzzy search

The query below will return Nevinyrral's Disk and other cards mentioning Nevinyrral in text 
    nevniniral~

You can refine your search by changing desired minimum similarity. Default similarity is 0.5, min 
is 0, max is 1.

    nevniniral~0.2
    nevniniral~0.9

Proximity search

The query below searches for text where words mana and color have 2 or less words between them.

    "Mana color"~2

Range search

You can correctly filter number fields like this:
    
	powerNum:[1 TO 4]

The numbers are indexed as numbers, not as text so no power 11 cards will appear between 1 and 4.

    PricingMid:{100 TO *}

will search cards with price strictly > than 100$

You can also use range search with text fields. Query below matches card with names containing 
any word which lies between 'a' and 'ced' in alphanumerical order

    Name:[a TO ced]

Term boosting

Term boosting is NOT supported because Mtgdb.Gui does not currently sort by relevance to search 
query. The query below is parsed and executed correctly but ^3 booster to Angel term is just 
ignored

    Angel^3 OR Demon
