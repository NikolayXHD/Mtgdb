The 7 button groups differ by the card property they correspond to.
These buttons filter cards by 
- card abilities (text)
- type
- rarity
- mana symbol in card abilities (text)
- generated mana
- converted mana cost
- mana cost

Checking the button in _top row_ (_right column_ for vertical panel) applies filter with operator AND.

Checking the button in _bottom row_ (_left column_ for vertical groups) applies filter with operator 
OR.

Filters by different properties are always joined through AND.

------------------------------------

Using Filter buttons and other User Interface elements you can set the following types of filters:
- Filter buttons
- Search text
- Legality filter
- Filter to cards present in your collection
- Filter to cards present in your deck

To select between AND / OR operators for those types use the the rightmost buttons group in top 
panel.

Just like with filter buttons checking in the _top row_ corresponds to AND, in the _bottom_ to OR.

If neither top or bottom is checked, the filter type is ignored when filtering cards.
