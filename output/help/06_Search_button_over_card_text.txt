When you hover a mouse over card text you can see a Search icon. It is in most cases followed by 
Sort icon.

Search button purpose
---------------------

By clicking Search icon you modify the search text. For example, if you click Search icon over 
card's mana cost you will see something like

    ManaCost: \{3\}\{W\}\{W\}

added to your search string. As a result the search result will only show cards that have mana 
cost `{3}{W}{W}`

Clicking Search button several times
------------------------------------

When you add more than one search terms you are ADDING more cards to search result. This is 
because when no logical operator such as `AND`, `OR` is used it is interpreted as `OR` in Lucene 
query language used in Search text.

By `Shift`+`Click`ing Search button you can instead NARROW DOWN search result. It is achiveved by 
adding terms with `+` operator which is almost equivalent to `AND`
