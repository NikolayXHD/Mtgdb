## Overview

**Mtgdb.Gui** is a *free* and *opensource* **Windows** application to help **Magic the Gathering** players build
decks. Card search features are well-thought, powerful and intutive. Users may limit the search to the cards
from their own collection.

Mtgdb.Gui supports several ways to input decks and collections. Some of them are blazingly fast like *drag-n-drop* as well as *copy* and *paste* operations from other applications or websites.

Decks can be saved in various formats compatible with other MTG-related applications such as
Magic the Gathering Online, Forge or XMage.

Graphical diagrams give you a high-level understanding of what is your current workset like.
The simplest example of a diagram is *mana curve*.

You can analyze your deck or collection from different angles by *building your own diagram*. 
It is conceptually the same as building *pivot table* or *pivot diagram* in Excel.

## Mtgdb.Controls project
Most non-standard WinForms controls used in Mtgdb.Gui were separated into a
project Mtgdb.Controls with no external dependencies. Thus you can copy-paste
it and reuse in your projects. What's there:

* Draggable tab headers control
* Tooltips with selectable text
* Album like data viewer
* Boolean filter buttons

To get an idea of what these controls look like and what they can I suggest seeing [wiki](https://github.com/NikolayXHD/Mtgdb/wiki)
for screenshots.

## Search text input
The search functionality in Mtgdb.Gui is quite advanced.
You type a search query in [Lucene query language](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html).
The query editor **highlights query syntax** and gives you **intellisense** when hitting `Ctrl`+`Space`
