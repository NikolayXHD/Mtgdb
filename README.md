## Mtgdb.Gui Overview

**Mtgdb.Gui** is a free and opensource desktop application to build *Magic the Gathering* decks 
with collection tracking and card prices. Supported operating systems are Windows and GNU/Linux 
desktops.

Search related features are well-thought and powerful. Search can be limited in scope to the cards
from the collection owned by user. Search for *similar cards* lets user find cards with resembling 
*text* and / or *generated mana*.

Mtgdb.Gui offers several ways to input decks and collections. The fastest are *drag-n-drop* and 
*copy* / *paste* from a website or another application.

Decks can be saved in various formats compatible with other MTG-related applications such as
Magic the Gathering Online, Forge or XMage.

Graphical diagrams give you a high-level understanding of what is your current workset like.
The simplest example of a diagram is *mana curve*.

You can analyze your deck or collection from different angles by *building your own diagram*. 
It is conceptually the same as building *pivot table* or *pivot diagram* in Excel.

## Mtgdb.Controls project
Most non-standard WinForms controls used in Mtgdb.Gui were separated into a
project Mtgdb.Controls with no external dependencies. Thus you can copy-paste
it and reuse in your projects. What's there:

* Draggable tab headers control
* Tooltips with selectable text
* Album like data viewer
* Boolean filter buttons

To get an idea of what these controls look like and what they can I suggest seeing [wiki](https://github.com/NikolayXHD/Mtgdb/wiki)
for screenshots.

## Search bar
The search functionality in Mtgdb.Gui is quite advanced.
You type a search query in [Lucene query language](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html).
The query editor **highlights query syntax** and gives you **intellisense** when hitting `Ctrl`+`Space`
